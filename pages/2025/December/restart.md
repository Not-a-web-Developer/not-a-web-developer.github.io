# I'm back!

better late than never lol

## It's been far too difficult getting this up and running.

I've spent _two_ years getting things into place for me to be able to host my own website, and even now there's some stupid workarounds i've had to do which i really didn't wanna do (for example, how this isn't actually running on its own dedicated hardware, or how it's running through cloudflare tunnels, and I'm pretty sure I don't have to lecture you about the issues with that); however, now that it's finally done, i think i need to start talking about everything that's happened since i last left this website to ~~die~~ gather dust on github's servers.

## i've bought a lot of hardware,

and i've seen even more hardware die in my hands. How much more? Well, in September (or october this year, i don't remember very well) i had every single piece of hardware i own develop faults or outright die within the span of a week.

I currently have a desktop workstation, an old GPU, and two laptops on my desk, with a gutted old computer on the floor beside me, another laptop and the guts of yet other computer in my wardrobe. out of all of them, only the workstation is working well enough for me to use it daily, so it's the machine everything is running on.  that said, it's not always been like this; right now, the only part common between the caldo i built in 2020 and the caldo of today is the 2 terabyte hard drive for bulk storage - everything else has been replaced, and the guts sit in my wardrobe (except for the GPU which works perfectly fine and so remains on my desk, longing for the day i have the time to clean and repaste it before i either sell it off or keep it in storage as a backup).

I have a laptop of my own (whose blog post never saw the light of day, because i could never complete it). my laptop has served me well, but because of events i'll talk about soon and my lack of care and attention during firmware upgrades, the firmware is acting really weird and refusting to recognise its dying battery, amongst other aberrant behaviour.

I got myself a netbook from relatives who wanted to throw it out, thinking i can replace the dead battery for much cheaper and have a true compact digital typewriter, but they keyboard died within a week of me having it. Then, when i started setting it up to be my last-ditch home server, the ethernet port and one of its two USB ports died, making it impossible for me to have both a keyboard and a USB stick to install alpine onto it. (as for why i chose alpine, i'll talk about it later.)

My second ever computer, the shitbox (the one i've talked about before over [here](/2021/October/pc-ded)), did have its guts replaced, but it kicked the bucket for good a couple of months ago, and i'm just done with it. I can, in theory, buy some RAM and figure out whether it's just the sticks dead or the motherboard too, but i don't think i'm seeing an affordable stick of RAM anytime soon, so expecting any progress on getting it running it again is nothing but wishful thinking.

there's also a very old fujitsu laptop in the wardrobe that i'm supposed to troubleshoot, hopefully fix, and return to its owner, but i have too many things to deal with at the moment, so it's locked away at the moment.

this is a lot of hardware, and more importantly this is a lot of very dysfunctional hardware. I don't know what to do with it, and i wish i had enough money not to have to wait months to make any progress at all.

where does all this money go, you ask? well, there's my overdependence on food as an emotional stabiliser, but there really is something more expensive  than takeout: 

## I ride motorcycles now!

unfortunately, i have the scars to prove it: I had a major crash in may 2024 (within a month of me starting to ride longer distances), and it took me the rest of the year to recover. I got myself my own motorcycle (which probably deserves its own blog post), but i ended up dropping it just yesterday, and burning my leg in the process (not to mention a broken brake lever, which will cost a pretty penny to replace).

That said, motorcycling satisfies an urge that cycling never really could: I get to travel much longer distances, and i get to have enough energy left to enjoy the view (both on the journey, and at the destination); i also get to travel without having to be limited to the bus or train (which are harder and harder to get a ticket for with an increase in population and reduction in services all across the country), and i don't even get motion sick and throw up!

it has truly been the best thing to happen to me in the last two years, and I probably wouldn't be here today if i didn't have this opportunity.
