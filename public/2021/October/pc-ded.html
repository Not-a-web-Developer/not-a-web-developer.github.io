<title>My PC Died :(</title></head>

<body>
    <br><div id="page-content"><h1 id="my-pc-died-">My PC Died :(</h1>
<p>So I have a pretty shitty PC of my own, that's been serving me really well for the past 9 years; it's a Dell Inspiron (affectionately called the shitbox / the idiot box) with an old i3, 8 gigs of RAM and a hard drive with windows 10 home on it.</p>
<p>now don't get me wrong, the CPU and the 8 gigs of DDR3 1600 MHz RAM can hold their own pretty well even today*</p>
<p>oh dear asterisk, you have tracked me down again.</p>
<h3 id="windows-however-does-not-like-it">Windows however, does not like it.</h3>
<p>So windows 10 seems to have a ton of telemetry going on in tne background, and Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry can be found sucking up 30-50% CPU at any given time.<br>
that's not a problem though, since there's a much bigger one:</p>
<h3 id="the-hard-drive">the hard drive.</h3>
<p>anyone who has ever used a hard drive as a boot drive knows how painful it is, and as it turns out, windows absolutely hates hard drives: it would always be stuck at 100% usage with seek times in the thousands (if not tens of thousands) of milliseconsds. running anything on that was really painful. But it was still a useful PC. it was My PC.</p>
<p>until we had a brownout, and the PSU blew up.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-where-the-problems-truly-begin">This is where the problems truly begin.</h2>
<p>so you know how it's a Dell pre-built? it's also small-form-factor, and the combination of these two led to the PSU (and the motherboard) being proprietary and not ATX/mATX/whatever.The problem with proprietary parts of any kind is that you have to go to the manufacturer for replacements.</p>
<h3 id="and-dell-hasnt-been-making-this-psu-model-for-years-now">and Dell hasn't been making this PSU model for years now</h3>
<p>of course, I can find it on ebay, but those are overpriced and come from sellers with very poor credibility, to be polite.</p>
<p>Or, I could try to buy a cheap no-name PSU (since calling the budget tight would be an understatement) and try to modify the connectors to fit the motherboard; but the PSU would have to live outside the case of the PC, since even an expensive SFX PSU would be too big to fit inside. now that's a fire hazard waiting to happen, and I'm not very comfortable with that.</p>
<p>one last option would be to salvage core components from the system that are not proprietary (like the CPU, the memory and stuff) and put it into a "new" case, a "new" H61 motherboard, and a cheap PSU to build a "new" PC with my old data in it (with hopefully the SSD upgrade coming soon, though this repair eats into the budget of that a lot).<br>
I prefer this over scrapping the PC and buying a new one because it'll be significantly cheaper and I don't wanna throw away parts that work just fine for what I do (which is mostly writing webpages and surfing the internet and stuff); but the hassle and risk of such a transplantation job when I'm not 100% sure that the PSU didn't take the CPU, memory and hard drive with it makes this option also slightly iffy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="i-have-to-choose-between-three-unfavourable-options">I have to choose between three unfavourable options,</h3>
<p>and i have no idea what to do. hopefully future me would've found a good solution and would laugh at this post thinking of the good old days when i would worry about small, irrelevant things. anyway, I have stuff to do and a ton of things to wrap up before I go to sleep, so I'll finish this post and tidy up the house.</p>
