<body>
    <br><div id="page-content"><h1 id="facebook-is-finally-dying">Facebook is finally dying.</h1>
<p>do you know how long i waited for it?</p>
<h2 id="but-im-not-here-to-talk-about-zuccs-grand-plan-or-something">But i'm not here to talk about zucc's grand plan or something.</h2>
<p>you see, the inspiration for this article stems from a simple thing that happened today: i asked my mom if she knew about the drop in stock price and the EU thing. she said yes, and then i asked her "if facebook products die, that includes whatsapp. what will you use if whatsapp dies?"</p>
<p>She had no answer.</p>
<h3 id="people-have-become-so-reliant-on-whatsapp-that-they-have-never-even-thought-about-alternatives">People have become so reliant on WhatsApp that they have never even thought about alternatives.</h3>

<p>this shouldn't have hit me in the face like a concrete wall at mach 2, but it did.</p>
<h3 id="so-i-have-decided-to-do-something-about-it">So, I have decided to do something about it.</h3>
<br>

<p>this is probably going to be too much effort, but i'm gonna take my parents on a tour of the entire world of instant messaging, from IRC to Signal and everything in between.</p>

<p>however, it's 2 AM at night and i'm sleepy, so i'll write more later.</p>
