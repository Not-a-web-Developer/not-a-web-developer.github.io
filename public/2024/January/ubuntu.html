    <br><div id="page-content"><h1 id="ive-been-using-ubuntu-as-my-daily-driver-for-more-than-a-year-now">I've been using Ubuntu as my daily-driver for more than a year now,</h1>
<p>And I'm not exactly loving this experience.</p>
<h2 id="at-this-point-you-the-reader-falls-into-one-of-two-camps">At this point, you the reader falls into one of two camps.</h2>
<p>You're either going "YEAH UBUNTU SUCKS LESGOOO" or you're going "Ubuntu? I've heard of it and know a couple of people that use it, what's so bad about it?"</p>
<p>However, I feel like this post of mine is for the second category of audience, and not the first. (mostly because past me was the second, and I don't think I'll ever want to be part of the first; despite me publishing these online, the primary audience for this is intended to be future me, and maybe whatever versiobn of past me still exists within future me)</p>
<p>Anyway, I need to start with the actual content of this <del>rant</del> post.</p>
<h2 id="linux-is-a-thing">Linux is a thing.</h2>
<p>Yeah. I don't really know better to explain it, because Linux isn't an OS; it's a kernel, but the ecosystem is so much more than just the kernel that going full "GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux" feels pedantic.</p>
<p>So yeah. A thing. </p>
<p>It's really nice to run servers on linux for me (haven't gotten into the world of BSDs quite yet), it's significantly less painful to try to set up C/C++, Python, Rust, or even Javascript environments on, and it's just really lightweight when you need to do something on very old hardware.</p>
<h3 id="with-all-those-advantages-someone-with-prior-experience-using-linux-would-want-to-use-a-linux-based-desktop-environment-for-daily-use">With all those advantages, someone with prior experience using Linux would want to use a linux-based desktop environment for daily use.</h3>
<p>That included me too, and I dabbled with desktop linux for years.</p>
<p>However, that would have a different article written for it, this one focuses solely on my ubuntu experience.</p>
<p>So, getting started, Ubuntu has two main versions of it: Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server, for desktop and server use respectively. (duh)</p>
<p>I'l talk about Ubuntu server first, since that was where I first started using Ubuntu, and desktop later, since I'm only using it now on my laptop <code>minuto</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ubuntu-server">Ubuntu Server.</h2>
<p>I first ran into Ubuntu server all the way back in 2013, when a friend of mine in school thought he could mine bitcoin on a vista-era all-in-one PC he had and coulr get rich quick (some things never change), and wanted my help installing linux for the endeavour.</p>
<p>I (rather naively) never thought bitcoin would be a big thing despite really liking the math behind the cryptocurrency, because I felt like nobody would want to spend compute resources to keep a community-run currency afloat, that isn't backed by a government. </p>
<p>I was wrong, but that's alright.</p>
<h3 id="either-way-the-guy-told-me-he-needed-something-called-ubuntu-linux-running-on-his-system-to-get-the-maximum-performance-needed-for-the-mining">Either way, the guy told me he needed something called ubuntu linux running on his system to get the maximum performance needed for the mining.</h3>
<p>Now I was lucky enough to win a book about IT infrastructure through a quiz back in school, that talked aobut networking, windows server and something called Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>I didn't understand a lot of things in the book when I got it, but I got the gist of the matter; There's operating systems other than windows, used primarily by businesses to run workstations and servers, and they used something called Linux as their core, rather than NT for Windows.</p>
<p>Because this Ubuntu Linux thing had the word "Linux" in it as well, I assumed it would be fairly similar to use.</p>
<h3 id="oh-how-wrong-was-i">oh how wrong was i</h3>
<p>I went to his house, intending to download ubuntu on his computer because the download would still take forever on my recently-upgraded 5 Mb/s internet connection (until a year before, we were using literal dial-up on a pentium 4 system running windows XP, so while this was a huge jump for me, I did understand it was still far behind what was needed for some stuff).</p>
<p>When I got there, he told me he already had a boot drive ready using some new-fangled thing called rufus, and handed me a CD.</p>
<p>Since CDs can only hold 700 MB, i was wondering how he got ubuntu to fit on it (from trials at home, I had found out that ubuntu desktop was <em>just barely</em> too large to fit on a CD).</p>
<p>The madlad thought I would be comfortable with text-mode, and had Ubuntu Server on that CD.</p>
<p>That was not a fun day, even if I look at it with rose-tinted glasses today and laugh.</p>
<p>Still, that baptism by fire did get me introduced to the idea of using linux on bare metal for a use-case that isn't a regular person doing regular person things (using an office suite, a media player, playing games, browsing the web); and, it made me better with computers, even if the end result was me being so traumatised by the experience i didn't touch linux again until </p>
